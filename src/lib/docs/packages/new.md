## Create new package
### How to create new packages from scratch

Packages are the most complicated to add so be sure to read through this guide before starting

Each package has a list of fields needed to add it to the database

@todo add fields list

on the second tab you'll see a list of all the items added to the package, please remember that you can not reorder those until after saving, by default they are added in the order created

you can click the button to add a new item this will bring up a popup with some fields to fill in

after you click save this item will show up in the list of items, please note that nothing you do on this page will be added to the database until you add the whole package, this is for items, products, and options

in each item you'll see a button saying add products, this is how you can add porducts to an item, when you open the new product popup you will have two options, you can either select from a list of products already in the system or you can create a new one, we strongly advise to use existing porducts as much as possible

after selecting a porduct it will be added to the items list, if you chose to create a new product you can then add options to that porduct, by clicking on the add options button

when you're done creating the package you can click on save this will save the package and redirect you to the edit page for this package
